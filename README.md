# VDIF File Processor Instructions for Use

## Purpose 
This program is a set of python modules which can be used for conducting RADAR signal processing with vdif files.

Particularly, this program can plot/print single-threaded vdif data as long as it is continuous, plot the spectral
and waterfall plots, conduct auto-correlation and match filtering (for Linear Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave
signals), and compensate for a changing return trip time using a PREDIX file.  













Make histogram (count for each value in time series data)
- Make pdf
Plot doppler S curve 
- doppler shift over time
JPL Horizons database
- look for asteroid
Try Nick's signal processing technique with 40 Mhz bandwidth chirp

Most of asteroid tracking is being done by Northern Hemisphere organisations, particular JPL at Goldstone.
Australia is trying to catch up and develop our own asteroids observing capabilities. Processing
FM CW is not a new technology. CW in the sense that the amplitude is not modulated. There a 
asteroids that Goldstone can't observe that can be boserved from the Southern Hemisphere.
If we develop Australian capabilities, we can fix the gap. 5% of asteroids are obly observable form the Southern
hemisphere. It's important to cover a large arc to get the best understanding of its motion. 

Theres been a new story about an asteroid that has a 1.5% chance that it'll hit the Earth in 2032. 
Tracking it optically. Optical for more of the time where. If the dinosaur had a space program then
they might be around still. 

Delay doppler images tell us about how the solar system formed. What you might be able to do to avoid it hitting the Earth.
Dart Mission would have been heavily influenced by radar analysis.
